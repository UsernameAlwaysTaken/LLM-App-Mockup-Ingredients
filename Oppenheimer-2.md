## Question:
Why did Oppenheimer lie to Colonel Pash?
And why did Leslie Groves panic when Oppenheimer told him that he lied to Colonel Pash?

### Answer (Claude Sonnet 4):
Oppenheimer lied to Colonel Pash about the identity of the Soviet contact who had approached him because he was protecting his friend and former student, Haakon Chevalier. When Pash interrogated Oppenheimer in 1943 about communist contacts trying to get atomic secrets, Oppenheimer spun this elaborate story about intermediaries and mysterious contacts - but he refused to name Chevalier, who had casually mentioned that he knew someone who could pass information to the Soviets.

The thing is, Chevalier's approach was more of a casual, "hey, I know a guy if you're ever interested" conversation rather than serious espionage. Oppenheimer knew this, but he also knew that naming Chevalier would destroy his friend's career and life. So he created this convoluted cover story that made the whole thing sound more dramatic and organized than it actually was.

Groves panicked when Oppenheimer finally came clean because the lie had massive implications for the Manhattan Project's security. If Oppenheimer - the scientific director of the most classified program in American history - was willing to lie to military intelligence about enemy contacts, what *else* might he be hiding? It called into question Oppenheimer's entire trustworthiness and judgment.

Plus, Groves had already vouched for Oppenheimer despite security concerns from others. If this got out, it would make Groves look like he'd made a catastrophic error in judgment. The whole project's credibility hung on maintaining absolute security, and here was their key scientist admitting he'd fabricated stories to protect a friend with communist connections.
