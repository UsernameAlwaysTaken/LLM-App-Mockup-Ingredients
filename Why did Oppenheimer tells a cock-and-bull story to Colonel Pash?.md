Why did Oppenheimer tells a cock-and-bull story to Colonel Pash?

He was trying to protect his friend, Haakon Chevalier, while simultaneously covering his own ass.

Chevalier had approached him about a potential channel for sharing information with the Soviets. Oppenheimer knew that if he named his friend directly, Chevalier's life and career would be utterly destroyed. At the same time, Oppenheimer's own security clearance was already shaky as fuck because of his wife's, brother's, and ex-fianc√©e's communist connections. Admitting a close friend was talking espionage would have been catastrophic.

So, he invented the elaborate story about three separate, anonymous contacts to try and alert security to the *general threat* without having to snitch. It was an arrogant and monumentally stupid attempt to have it both ways, and it's the lie that ultimately cost him everything during his security hearing years later.

It's a classic case of a brilliant man making a profoundly dumb, human decision. What do you think drove it more: loyalty to a friend, or an arrogant belief that he could outsmart everyone?
